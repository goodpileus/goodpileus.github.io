        <p>Good day my visitors, my name is Aidan Quinlan and I enjoy making graphics and websites.  I am a student at Flagstaff High School, located in Flagstaff, Arizona right next to the Grand Canyon.  I mainly work inside Adobe Illustrator when making a graphic, though I do ocasionally work with Photoshop; I was previously enrolled in a graphic design course.  When designing web pages I use Adobe Dreamweaver (of course) and am currently enrolled in a web design course.</p>

        "WHEN I AM AN OLD MAN I SHALL DO AS I PLEASE.<br />
        I'LL NOT COVER MY MOUTH WHEN I COUGH OR I SNEEZE.<br />
        I'LL PUT ON A SHIRT THAT SPENT A WEEK ON THE FLOOR.<br />
        I'LL EAT FIVE OR SIX COOKIES AND GO BACK FOR MORE.<br />
        I'LL BURP AND I'LL BELCH, PASS GAS WITH A WINK,<br />
        I'LL EAT FROM A DISH THAT SPENT WEEKS IN THE SINK.<br />
        MY FAVORITE FOODS WILL COME FROM A CAN,<br />
        I'LL EAT EVERY HOUR, THAT IS MY PLAN.<br />
        I'LL FORGET MY ZIPPER, NOW THAT'S NOT SO BAD,<br />
        FOR ALL YOU KNOW IT MIGHT START A NEW FAD.<br />
        WHEN I AM AN OLD MAN, I'LL SAY WHAT I THINK.<br />
        I'LL TELL YOU I'M TIRED OF BELLIES WITH RINGS.<br />
        I'M TIRED OF NOSES AND TONGUES THAT GO CLINK.<br />
        WHEN I AM AN OLD MAN I WONT HAVE TO BRAG,<br />
        NO SPECIAL COLORS FOR ME, I'LL BE STARTING TO SAG.<br />
        MY COLOR IS GRAY, HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.<br />
        IT'S THE COLOR OF HAIR THAT GROWS IN MY EARS.<br /> 
        I WONT NEED TO WEAR RED OR PURPLE YOU SEE,<br />
        I'LL ADMIT THAT I'M OLD WHEN I'M ONE HUNDRED AND THREE."<br />
