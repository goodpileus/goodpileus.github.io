hello, welcome to my website

this is a place to browse the files that i'd like to share with others, as well as some occasional words and updates from me. i was once very averse to creating an archive for myself, but this site is turning out to be something like that. maybe one day it will feel too heavy and i'll have to move into a new shell.

> &mdash;&mdash;

at the moment:
- teaching [Handmade Web](https://handmade-web.net/) at VCU
- working on some websites
- translating Fool's Rest into a website

> &mdash;&mdash;

this version of the site is still young. \
i'm working on getting all the rooms together...

to do:
- blog/writing space
- filters for studio
- more photos
