<!-- today is sunday -->
<!-- today we do nothing -->

<!-- it is february 10, 2019 -->
<!-- the lots have been cast and the week has been spent. i suppose i can't turn back. my body has already broken into the new space. as i speed by, i see the abandoned cars lining the highway. i am here, now here, now here, now here, now here, now here. they are still there. the dust is sticking to them. the green is seeding in them. ahead, what river runners call 'the hole' lies in hungry wait. we hasten towards it. we summon more paddle-bearers to the sides of our raft. they dip the wedge into the current and thrust.-->
