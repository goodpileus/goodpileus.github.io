  <p>This may be our town's strangest villian yet. A giant derpy apple tree sprung up in the middle of town. This strange tree called it's self the "Applevenger". This perplexing tree entrapped most of the city in its roots and dropped giant apples on the streets crushing whatever they landed on. Magical Cake Bob came to our resuce and defeated this villian by cutting off its roots and then ripping the tree from the ground and throwing the villian into a volcano.</p>
