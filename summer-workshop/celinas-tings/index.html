  <h1>an intro, i guess</h1>

<p>the mind is a scary area to be stuck in.</p>
<p>and sometimes we're there for longer than expected, or even wanted.</p>

<img src="break.jpg">
<p>it's weird, the things that happen to people throughout a lifetime. we get broken, literally and figuratively, by things we never thought would hurt as much as it inevitably does. "can I break them?" is a thought brought by due to the need of power. power over food, power over people, power over objects, and power over society as a whole.
</p>

<div class="circle"></div>
<img src="worm.jpg">
<p> when one reaches the process of breaking said thing, and it's successful, it allows for it to come apart. (we been knew) and thus either die, or break into two. </p>
<p>so basically, i'm monkey.</P>
