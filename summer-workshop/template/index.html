      "We have been so desensitized by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called "technology " at all. As if linen were the same thing as flax â€” as if paper, ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural objects, born with us like our teeth and fingers -- as if steel saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece vests spun from recycled glass grew on trees, and we just picked them when they were ripe..."

      <!-- The <img> tag is for inserting images into a page, every <img> tag needs an src or "source" and and alt attribute, which assits in accesibility if the image is unable to load or be seen by the user. We can use a url taken from somewhere else on the internet or we can refer to our own image that we've included in our website folder. The path to the image is important and depends on the location of your html document. -->
